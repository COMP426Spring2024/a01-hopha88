<!--
 the word dragon is genreally used as an umbrella term for any of these lizard guys. some people care and distinguish them further based on their body parts
 so if you wanted to get really specific, there are also other ways of reffering to different types of dragons. 
 for the sake of making this distingushment as clear as possible, if any kind of dragon can be furhter distinguished it shall be described accordingly.

 1. the standard western dragon:
    - 4 legs, 2 wings.
    - probably breaths fire
    - the ol' reliable the classic, no mod vanilla
    - might have a hoarde of trasure or a princess locked in a dungeon

    Dragon (shrek), Toothless (HTTYD), Saphira (Eragon), 
    Clay (Wings of Fire), Smaug (the hobbit, but in the book), Blue Eyes White Dragon (Yu-Gi-Oh!)

 2. wyvern:
    the other "standard" dragon (unless u think they arent dragons then go off).
    2 legs, 2 wings
    also probably breaths fire, but like one guy on reddit says they dont

    Alduin/Paarthurnax (The Elder Scrolls), Drogon/Viserion/Rhaegal (game of thrones, the show i didnt read past like chapter two in the books so idk), Smaug (the hobbit, but the movie)

3. the standard eastern dragon:
    no wings

    contrary to western dragons, eastern dragons are often symbols of good rather than evil.

    Shenron (Dragon Ball), Ran/Shaw (Avatar the Last Airbender), Haku (Spirited Away)
        

Here's some more types but i ran out of time lol:
drake, lindwyrm, wymb, amphithere
