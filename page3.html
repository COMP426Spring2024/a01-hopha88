    this page i literally only talk about my opinion on dragons (spoiler alert: i think they're pretty awesome)

    i just kind of think dragons are the coolest thing ever. they arent real and can be whatever u want them to be. but
    i think deep inside, the child of my heart will forever ache about never being able to saor the skies on the back of
    my own dragon companion. or perhaps die a horrible death bathed in dragon fire. either works.
    most people dont care, but there are some absolutle loser nerds (me) who care about the distingushment of dragons,
    wyverns, wyrms, drakes, etc.
    the depiction of dragons i personally like is wyverns because the biology of arm-shoulder ratio makes more sense,
    but they can literally breath fire so it doesnt matter tbh

    sometimes it can be kind of hard to know what kind of dragon were dealing with when reading a book, as its usually
    not easy to fit detailed physical descriptions mid-narrative.
    this means that there tends to be a lot of misinterpretations when it comes to movie adaptations of dragons (e.g. Smaug, who has four legs and two wings as depicted at the front of the book, drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. In the movie, Smaug is depicted as a wyvern.)

    speaking of movie adaptations, when i was a kid i was sooooo obcessed with the how to train your dragon movies. making friends with your enemy, how awesome is that?! 
    eventually i got around to getting a copy of the book and ooooohhhhhh boooyy.
    never in the history of the universe has someone said the movie adaptation of a story is better than the book, but how to train your dragon was a stunning first
    its not necessarily a bad story, but its just kind of lame compared to the movie, and the world building isnt as immersive. did you know, in the book toothless the dragon is ACTUALLY toothless. he has no teeth. also hes the size of a cat.
